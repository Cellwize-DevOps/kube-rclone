# kube-rclone

## Introduction

kube-rclone is a rclone mount solution for Kubernetes. It allows you to sync files and directories to and from different cloud storage providers i.e Google Drive. It creates a Daemonset across the Kubernetes cluster which mounts a volume on the `hostPath` that can be used with other services such as [kube-plex](https://github.com/munnerz/kube-plex)
